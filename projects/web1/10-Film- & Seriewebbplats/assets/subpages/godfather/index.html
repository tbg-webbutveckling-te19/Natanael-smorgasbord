            <h4>This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.
                It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. 
                Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film,
                the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.
                Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. 
                This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.</h4>
